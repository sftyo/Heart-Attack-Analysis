# Heart-Attack-Analysis
Analysis on Heart Attack datasets to explore and classify which person will have a heart attack based on the available feature/parameter. This is a simple project which include a little bit of data cleaning, EDA, and modelling.

# Introduction

This is a simple data analysis project that tries to classify a person who has a heart attack (the output) using Logistic Regression.
In the notebook there are 3 main parts :
- Data Overview / Data Prep
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Modelling

# Insights
Based on the visualization on the datasets there are a couple insights that we could get:
- thalach and cp have a not too high and not too low positive correlation with the output
- A person with normal thallasemia has a higher risk of getting a heart attack
- A person with downsloping has a higher risk of getting heart attack

# Conclusion
There needs to be a deeper analysis and understanding to understand the correlation between parameter and also feature engineering to get a better accuracy.
